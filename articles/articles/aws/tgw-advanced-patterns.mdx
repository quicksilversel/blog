## The Reality of Transit Gateway at Scale

Everyone knows Transit Gateway is AWS's answer to the "VPC peering mesh from hell" problem. But after managing TGW across multiple accounts, dealing with cross-account resource sharing drama, and debugging route propagation issues at 2 AM, I've learned that the real complexity isn't in setting it up — it's in operating it at scale.

This isn't your typical "here's how to create a TGW" tutorial. This is about the patterns, pitfalls, and production lessons that only come from actually running this thing in anger.

## Quick TGW Refresher

Before we dive into the main content, let's quickly align on what Transit Gateway actually does and why it matters.

### What Problem Does TGW Solve?

Remember the old days? You'd have:

- VPC peering connections everywhere (n\*(n-1)/2 connections for n VPCs)
- Separate VPN connections to each VPC for on-premises connectivity
- Complex routing tables that nobody understood
- No transitive routing (A→B→C didn't work)

Transit Gateway replaces this mess with a single hub that:

- **Acts as a cloud router** — Connect VPCs, VPNs, Direct Connect, and other TGWs through one central point
- **Enables transitive routing** — Traffic can flow through the TGW to reach any connected network
- **Scales horizontally** — Handles up to 5 Gbps per VPC attachment, 50 Gbps aggregate
- **Supports multiple route tables** — Segment traffic based on security requirements

### Core Components at a Glance

```yaml
# The basic building blocks you'll be working with
Components:
  TransitGateway:
    Purpose: 'The central hub'
    Limits: '5 per region, 5000 VPC attachments'

  Attachments:
    Types: ['VPC', 'VPN', 'Direct Connect Gateway', 'Peering', 'Connect']
    KeyPoint: 'Each attachment is a network connection to the TGW'

  RouteTables:
    Purpose: 'Control traffic flow between attachments'
    Association: 'Each attachment associates with exactly one route table'
    Propagation: 'Attachments can propagate routes to multiple tables'
```

Now that we're on the same page about what TGW is and what it does, let's talk about what happens when you actually run this in production across multiple accounts, regions, and teams — because that's where things get interesting (and occasionally terrifying).

## Advanced Architecture Patterns

### The Multi-Account Transit Hub Pattern

Forget the basic hub-and-spoke. In real enterprises, you're dealing with multiple AWS accounts, each with their own networking requirements, compliance boundaries, and — let's be honest — political territories.

Here's the pattern that actually works:

```yaml
# The centralized network account owns the TGW
Resources:
  TransitGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGateway
    Properties:
      Description: Central transit hub
      DefaultRouteTableAssociation: disable
      DefaultRouteTablePropagation: disable
      # This is critical for multi-account
      AmazonSideAsn: 64512
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: tgw-central
        - Key: Environment
          Value: shared
        - Key: CostCenter
          Value: networking # Yes, this matters politically
```

The key insight: **Disable default route table association and propagation**. You want explicit control over routing decisions, not AWS making assumptions for you.

### Segmented Route Tables for Security Zones

Production networks aren't flat. You've got prod, dev, DMZ, shared services — each with different security postures. Here's how to segment properly:

```yaml
Parameters:
  Environment:
    Type: String
    AllowedValues: [production, development, staging]

Mappings:
  SecurityZones:
    production:
      CidrBlocks: '10.0.0.0/16'
      AllowedDestinations: 'shared_services,dmz_egress'
    development:
      CidrBlocks: '10.1.0.0/16'
      AllowedDestinations: 'shared_services,dmz_egress,development'
    dmz:
      CidrBlocks: '10.2.0.0/16'
      AllowedDestinations: 'dmz_egress'
    shared_services:
      CidrBlocks: '10.3.0.0/16'
      AllowedDestinations: 'production,development'

Resources:
  # Create route table for each security zone
  ProductionRouteTable:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayRouteTable
    Properties:
      TransitGatewayId: !Ref TransitGateway
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: tgw-rt-production
        - Key: SecurityZone
          Value: production

  DevelopmentRouteTable:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayRouteTable
    Properties:
      TransitGatewayId: !Ref TransitGateway
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: tgw-rt-development
        - Key: SecurityZone
          Value: development
```

The magic is in the `can_reach` mapping. This becomes your network security policy as code.

## Cross-Account Resource Sharing: The Hard Parts

### RAM Sharing That Actually Works

AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is how you share TGW across accounts. But here's what the docs don't tell you:

```yaml
Resources:
  TGWResourceShare:
    Type: AWS::RAM::ResourceShare
    Properties:
      Name: !Sub 'tgw-share-${Environment}'
      AllowExternalPrincipals: false # Start with false!
      ResourceArns:
        - !Sub 'arn:aws:ec2:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:transit-gateway/${TransitGateway}'
      Tags:
        - Key: Purpose
          Value: TGW cross-account sharing

  # The gotcha: You need the principal associations
  SpokeAccountAssociation:
    Type: AWS::RAM::ResourceShareAssociation
    Properties:
      ResourceShareArn: !Ref TGWResourceShare
      AssociatedEntity: !Ref SpokeAccountId # From Parameters
      AssociationStatus: ASSOCIATING
```

> **Critical lesson**: Don't set `allow_external_principals = true` unless you absolutely need it. It opens up sharing outside your AWS Organization, which is rarely what you want.

### The Attachment Configuration Dance

This is where things get messy. Each spoke account needs to:

1. Accept the RAM invitation (often forgotten!)
2. Create the attachment
3. Configure route tables

But here's the killer pattern — use parameters to pass the shared TGW ID:

```yaml
# In the spoke account template
Parameters:
  TransitGatewayId:
    Type: String
    Description: Shared Transit Gateway ID from network account

  NetworkAccountId:
    Type: String
    Description: AWS Account ID that owns the TGW

Resources:
  VPCAttachment:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayVpcAttachment
    Properties:
      TransitGatewayId: !Ref TransitGatewayId
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      SubnetIds:
        - !Ref PrivateSubnetA
        - !Ref PrivateSubnetB

      # This is crucial for routing control
      Options:
        DnsSupport: enable
        Ipv6Support: disable
        ApplianceModeSupport: disable

      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub 'tgw-attach-${Environment}'
```

## Production Gotchas and Solutions

### The Route Propagation Mystery

Ever had routes that should propagate but don't? Here's the debugging checklist I've built from painful experience:

```bash
# Check attachment state
aws ec2 describe-transit-gateway-attachments \
  --filters "Name=transit-gateway-id,Values=tgw-xxx" \
  --query 'TransitGatewayAttachments[].{ID:TransitGatewayAttachmentId,State:State,Association:Association}'

# Verify route table associations
aws ec2 get-transit-gateway-route-table-associations \
  --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-xxx

# The money shot - actual propagations
aws ec2 get-transit-gateway-route-table-propagations \
  --transit-gateway-route-table-id tgw-rtb-xxx
```

90% of the time, it's because:

1. The attachment isn't associated with the right route table
2. Propagation is enabled but the source doesn't have routes to propagate
3. Overlapping CIDR blocks (TGW silently drops these)

### The Asymmetric Routing Trap

This one's subtle. You've got traffic flowing A→B but not B→A. Classic symptoms:

- SSH works one way
- Health checks fail randomly
- Intermittent timeouts

The fix? Always configure routes symmetrically:

```yaml
Resources:
  # Don't just add the route one way
  ProdToSharedRoute:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayRoute
    Properties:
      DestinationCidrBlock: !Ref SharedServicesCidr
      TransitGatewayAttachmentId: !Ref SharedServicesAttachment
      TransitGatewayRouteTableId: !Ref ProductionRouteTable

  # You need the return path too!
  SharedToProdRoute:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayRoute
    Properties:
      DestinationCidrBlock: !Ref ProductionCidr
      TransitGatewayAttachmentId: !Ref ProductionAttachment
      TransitGatewayRouteTableId: !Ref SharedServicesRouteTable
```

## Advanced Patterns for Scale

### Dynamic Route Learning with BGP

If you're connecting to on-premises or using SD-WAN, you'll want BGP. Here's the pattern that actually works in production:

```yaml
Resources:
  CustomerGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::CustomerGateway
    Properties:
      BgpAsn: 65000 # Your on-prem ASN
      IpAddress: !Ref CustomerGatewayIP
      Type: ipsec.1
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: cgw-datacenter

  VPNConnection:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPNConnection
    Properties:
      CustomerGatewayId: !Ref CustomerGateway
      TransitGatewayId: !Ref TransitGateway
      Type: ipsec.1
      StaticRoutesOnly: false # Enable BGP

  # Enable route propagation from VPN
  VPNAttachmentPropagation:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGatewayRouteTablePropagation
    Properties:
      TransitGatewayAttachmentId: !Ref VPNConnection
      TransitGatewayRouteTableId: !Ref ProductionRouteTable
```

Pro tip: Use BGP communities to tag routes for different handling:

```bash
# On your edge router
ip community-list standard PROD_ROUTES permit 65000:100
ip community-list standard DEV_ROUTES permit 65000:200

route-map TO_AWS permit 10
 match community PROD_ROUTES
 set as-path prepend 65000
```

### Cost Optimization Patterns

TGW charges add up fast. Here's how to optimize:

1. **Attachment Consolidation**: Don't create separate attachments for every little thing
2. **Regional Hub Pattern**: Use TGW peering instead of duplicating TGWs
3. **Traffic Engineering**: Route internet-bound traffic directly, not through TGW

```yaml
Resources:
  # Smart routing to avoid unnecessary TGW charges
  PrivateRouteTable:
    Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC

  InternetRoute:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Route
    Properties:
      RouteTableId: !Ref PrivateRouteTable
      DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
      NatGatewayId: !Ref NATGateway
      # NOT TransitGatewayId - avoid TGW charges!
```

## Monitoring and Observability

You can't manage what you can't measure. Essential metrics:

```python
# CloudWatch custom metric for route table size
import boto3

def check_route_table_size():
    ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')

    response = ec2.describe_transit_gateway_route_tables()

    for rt in response['TransitGatewayRouteTables']:
        routes = ec2.search_transit_gateway_routes(
            TransitGatewayRouteTableId=rt['TransitGatewayRouteTableId'],
            MaxResults=100
        )

        cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
            Namespace='TGW/RouteTableSize',
            MetricData=[{
                'MetricName': 'RouteCount',
                'Value': len(routes['Routes']),
                'Dimensions': [
                    {'Name': 'RouteTableId', 'Value': rt['TransitGatewayRouteTableId']},
                    {'Name': 'Environment', 'Value': rt['Tags'].get('Environment', 'unknown')}
                ]
            }]
        )
```

Set alarms when route tables approach limits (10,000 routes per table).

## CI/CD for Network Changes

Network changes are scary. Here's a battle-tested CloudFormation workflow that's saved me from disasters:

[Deploying CloudFormation with GitHub Actions](/articles/devops/deploy-cfn-with-gha)

### The CloudFormation-Specific Gotchas

After migrating from Terraform to CloudFormation for TGW management, here are the lessons learned:

1. **Change Sets Are Your Friend**: Never update directly. Change sets show you exactly what will happen.

2. **The "No Updates" Trap**: CloudFormation fails change sets with no changes. Handle this gracefully:

   ```bash
   if [[ "$REASON" == *"no updates"* ]]; then
     echo "No changes needed"
     exit 0
   fi
   ```

3. **Wait Conditions Matter**: Don't just fire and forget. That `wait change-set-create-complete` has prevented many race conditions.

4. **S3 Templates for Large Stacks**: Direct template body has size limits. Always use S3 for production:

   ```bash
   aws s3 cp template.yaml s3://bucket/templates/${{ github.sha }}.yaml
   aws cloudformation create-change-set --template-url https://...
   ```

5. **GitHub Environments for Safety**: The `environment: production` line is crucial. It creates a deployment gate:

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     environment: production # This requires manual approval!
   ```

   Combined with GitHub's deployment protection rules, this ensures someone with proper access must explicitly click "Deploy" before any changes hit production. No more accidental merges taking down the network at 3 AM.

   Pro tip: Configure your environment with required reviewers who actually understand networking:

   ```yaml
   # In your repo settings → Environments → production
   - Required reviewers: @network-team
   - Wait timer: 5 minutes (gives time to catch mistakes)
   - Deployment branches: main only
   ```

The key: **Always review change sets before execution**. A misconfigured route table can take down production faster than you can say "rollback." The manual approval gate has saved us more times than I'd like to admit.

## The Politics of Network Architecture

Let's be real — the technical challenges are only half the battle. Here's how to navigate the organizational aspects:

### Cost Attribution

```yaml
Parameters:
  CostCenter:
    Type: String
    Description: Cost center code for billing

  ChargebackCode:
    Type: String
    Description: Chargeback code for internal accounting

# Tag everything with cost centers
Resources:
  TransitGateway:
    Type: AWS::EC2::TransitGateway
    Properties:
      Tags:
        - Key: CostCenter
          Value: !Ref CostCenter
        - Key: ChargebackCode
          Value: !Ref ChargebackCode
        - Key: DataTransferTo
          Value: track-me-please
```

Finance will thank you when they can actually attribute the $10K/month TGW bill.

### Access Control Patterns

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ReadOnlyTGW",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeTransitGateways",
        "ec2:DescribeTransitGatewayRouteTables",
        "ec2:GetTransitGatewayRouteTableAssociations"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ModifyOnlyOwnAttachments",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:ModifyTransitGatewayVpcAttachment",
        "ec2:DeleteTransitGatewayVpcAttachment"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "ec2:ResourceTag/Owner": "${aws:PrincipalTag/team}"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Give teams autonomy while maintaining guardrails.

## The TL;DR Checklist

If you take away nothing else:

1. **Disable default route propagation** — Be explicit about routing
2. **Test asymmetric routing** — It will happen, be ready
3. **Monitor route table size** — You'll hit limits before you expect
4. **Use RAM carefully** — Cross-account sharing is powerful but complex
5. **Tag everything** — Future you will thank present you
6. **Automate with change sets** — But always human-review route changes
7. **Plan for BGP** — Even if you don't need it today
8. **Document security zones** — Network segmentation as code

Transit Gateway isn't just a network hub — it's the backbone of your multi-account strategy. Treat it with the respect (and automation) it deserves.
