## Introduction

Code highlighting is a crucial feature for developers who want to present their code snippets in a readable and visually appealing manner. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of adding code highlighting to MDX using Prism, NextJS, and TypeScript. By following these steps, you'll be able to effortlessly integrate syntax highlighting into your MDX content, enhancing the readability and professionalism of your documentation or blog posts.

### Intended Audiences

This article is written for developers that are familiar with the basics of React, NextJS, TypeScript and MDX

> Versions of the install packages
>
> [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/): 14.2.4,
>
> [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) : 5.0.0,
>
> [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) : 2.3.1,
>
> [react](https://react.dev/) : 18.3.1

### Install prism-react-renderer

[https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)

```bash
npm install --save prism-react-renderer
```

### Create the Highlight component

```jsx
import { ReactNode, isValidElement } from "react";

import { Highlight } from "prism-react-renderer";

type Props = {
  children?: ReactNode,
};

export const HighlightedCode = ({ children }: Props) => {
  if (
    !isValidElement(children) ||
    typeof children.props.children !== "string"
  ) {
    return null;
  }

  const code = children.props.children;

  if (!code) return null;

  const language = children.props.className?.replace("language-", "").trim();

  return (
    <Highlight code={code} language={language}>
      {({ tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre>
          {tokens.map((line, index) => (
            <div key={`token-${index}`} {...getLineProps({ line })}>
              {line.map((token, index) => (
                <span key={`line-${index}`} {...getTokenProps({ token })} />
              ))}
            </div>
          ))}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  );
};
```

Although `children: JSX.Element` would be a more accurate type definition for children, it is necessary that we use ReactNode since the type of component element in MDX is set as optional `children: ReactNode`.

```jsx
type Props = {
  children?: JSX.Element,
};
```

This is why it is necessary to include the following code, to avoid the consequending type errors.

```jsx
if (!isValidElement(children) || typeof children.props.children !== 'string') {
  return null
}
```

Many articles I have found online appear to use older versions of prism-react-renderer. If you encountered the following issue, it is likely due to changes introduced in [Prism's v2 update](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer?tab=readme-ov-file#upgrade), where `defaultProps` is no longer supported and is now included within the `Highlight` component by default.

```jsx
Module '"prism-react-renderer"' has no exported member 'defaultProps'
```

### Finally, include it in your MDX

```jsx
<MDXRemote
  {...source}
  components={{
    pre: HighlightedCode,
  }}
/>
```

And voila! Our code is now highlighted!
